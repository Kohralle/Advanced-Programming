## Advanced Programming

The course’s premise was to complete two lengthy assignments in plain Java (almost no packages allowed). For assignments, programs were written that read two sets of identifiers from standard input, apply four operations (difference, intersection, union, symmetric difference) on these sets, and print the results of these operations to standard output. The intricacy of this course was that students had to abide by predefined methods and special rules dictated by a professor that incorporated the technologies listed in the “Course Content” section in the link above. Failure to follow these rules would result in a gradual decrease of a grade or even failing the course. Every week there was a consultation session with an advisor to ask for tips and to see if the program is being written correctly. I managed to score 80% in this course.
